## :thinking:ðŸ’» How to Contribute?

- Take a look at the existing ```Issues```
- Create a ```Pull Request```, which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.
- Add screenshot in your ```Pull Request``` to help ```Project Admin``` understand the effects of the changes that are included in your commits.


## :man_shrugging: How to make a Pull Request?

# Task 1: Forking the repo

- To work on a project, we will need to make exact copy of your repo. For doing this, we first fork the repo and then clone it so that we have a local working copy. get your own copy of repo by clicking ```Fork``` button right upper corner !!
 

# Task 2: Clone the forked repo

- After the repo is forked, we can now clone it so that we can have a local copy of the codebase. To make our local copy of the do follow these steps,

**:star: Note: Origin = Repo link of our forked project where we are contributing**

- Open the Command Prompt
- Type this command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Repo Name
```

# Task 3: Creating a new branch

- This is VIMP step that must be followed to contribute to Open Source organization. A branch helps to manage the workflow, by isolating our code and does not create a mess. To create a new branch,

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

- After this we keep our cloned repo up-to-date by pulling from the upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

**:star: Note: Upstream = Repo link of project where we are contributing**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

# Task 4: Contribute

- We will make our changes according to the issue that we are assigned for !!


# Task 5: Commit and Push

- Once we have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repo, which we can do with the git add command.

```bash
git add .
```

- With our file staged, weâ€™ll want to record the changes that we made to the repo with the git commit command.
- The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is.

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed Issue Number message"
```

At this point we can use the **git push command** to push the changes to the current branch of our forked repo **i.e origin**,

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```


# Task 6: Create Pull Request

Now, we are ready to make a **PR** to the original repo **i.e, Upstream**. Now, we should navigate to our **origin repo**, and press the ```Compare & pull request``` button on the page. We should add in a title, a comment, and then press the ```Create pull request``` button.


# Task 7: Create a PR

# Task 8: **Congratulations!** :tada: :tada: You've made your first contribution!
