  - How to Contribute?
  - How to make a Pull Request?

## :thinking:ðŸ’» How to Contribute?

- Take a look at the existing ```Issues```
- Create a ```Pull Request```, which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.
- Add screenshot in your ```Pull Request``` to help ```Project Admin``` understand the effects of the changes that are included in your commits.


## :man_shrugging: How to make a Pull Request?

# Task 1: Forking the repository

- To work on a project, we will need to make exact copy of your repository. For doing this, we first fork the repository and then clone it so that we have a local working copy. get your own copy of repository by clicking ```Fork``` button right upper corner !!
 
<br><br>

# Task 2: Clone the forked Repository

- After the repository is forked, you can now clone it so that you have a local working copy of the codebase. To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:

- Open the Command Prompt
- Type this command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Cool-Front-End_Templates
```

<br><br>
# Task 3: Creating a new branch (IMP)

- This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute to Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not create a mess. To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

- Keep your cloned repo up-to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

<br><br>
# Task 4: Contribute

- Make relevant changes according to the issue that you were assigned on. Contribute in any way you feel like :)

<br>
# Task 5: Commit and Push

- Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which we can do with the git add command.

```bash
git add .
```

- With our file staged, weâ€™ll want to record the changes that we made to the repository with the git commit command.
- The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is.

```bash
git commit -m "useful commit message"
```

At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

<br>
## Task 6: Create Pull Request

Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository. Now, You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the "Compare & pull request" button on the page. GitHub will alert you that you can merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a title, a comment, and then press the ```Create pull request``` button.


## Task 7: Create a PR
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!

## Task 8: **Congratulations!** :tada: :tada: You've made your first contribution!
